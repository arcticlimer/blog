title: Solving Git Conflicts
---

As I heard once, now I think handling git conlficts is one of the most critical
parts of a project. If you don't do it extremely carefully, you will end up
messing something up and having to *redo* the conflict solving or waste some
nice time figuring out what did you do wrong when merging.

So it's really worth it to invest some extra time by paying attention and
double-checking what you're doing the merging branches with conflicts.
