        <p>Around April this year I've started getting crazy about mechanical ergonomic
split keyboards. After a lot of (over)thinking, I've decided to go with a Dactyl
Manuform Mini 5x6 over the original Manuform. Its thumb cluster just seems
better overall, most of the keys in the original's thumb cluster seem very
hard/painful to reach.</p>
<p>After buying some <em>blank white PBT keycaps</em> and <em>70 Gateron Milky Yellow</em> switches
from AliExpress, waiting a month for them to arrive and printing the case at the
local university, I've assembled the board with a total cost of around $70
dollars, much cheaper than the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">ErgoDox</a> that I was
considering before, which would easily cost more than 500$ after taxes in Brazil.</p>
<p>Another unique benefit of building your own keyboard is that you can use <a href="https://qmk.fm">QMK</a>, which allows you to write the firmware for your own keyboard easily. Thus making your keybinds and macros portable between different operational systems.</p>
<p>After two months of use, the keyboard is still holding strong and is very comfortable to type with. 10/10 would recommend.</p>
