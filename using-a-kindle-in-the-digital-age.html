        <p>In the last Amazon Prime Day, I've bought a <em>10th Generation Kindle</em>. Before
that, I would say I preferred downloading and reading PDFs in my personal
computer instead of say, having a Kindle. After first using one it completely
blew my mind how cool the it actually is.</p>
<p>The fact that it's a simple e-book reader means that it does its job, and does
it really well. It offers a nice reading experience, high battery lifetime, the
10th gen ones have embedded light for dark environments and the most important:
It's just a reading tool. Even though we live our overconnected lives in this
world, there are no distracting notifications or the possibility of opening some
random app to waste time when you're using a Kindle.</p>
<p>Having acquired a Kindle really made me enjoy reading a lot more. And now I
really feel like I <strong>want</strong> to read books instead of wasting time doing
activities such as using the cellphone in bed.</p>
