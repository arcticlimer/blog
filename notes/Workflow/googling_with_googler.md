title: Googling from the CLI using Googler
---

# Intro
Today I've discovered about [googler](https://github.com/jarun/googler), it's a
CLI program that allows you to make google queries from your terminal.
Usually when I need to google something while programming, be it an error,
  issue or documentation I spin up a new browser tab with the query using [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb). Then I spend some more time scrolling down trying to find what I want. Using **googler**, I just need to enter my query and press **enter**, then I have a clean view of the search results and I can open them directly with my browser using **googler**'s commandline interface.

# Small googler cheat sheet

- `<number>`: Opens the *nth* result in your browser.
- `n`: Goes to the next page of results.
- `p`: Goes to the previous page of results.
- `f`: Goes to the first page of results.
