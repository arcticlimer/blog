        Colony Simulators</h1></a>
<p>I really like colony simulators. The only thing with them is that they take
usually a lot of time (hours per run). Other than that, when played with the
right mindset, they can prove to be very fun and replayable.</p>

          <a class="no-underline" href="#dwarf-fortress">
              <h2 id="dwarf-fortress" class="group relative">
              <span class="hidden group-hover:inline absolute -left-8">#</span>
        Dwarf Fortress</h2></a>
<p>No words to describe Dwarf Fortress. It is simply awesome. You can do all sorts
of stuff and all the game simulates an incredible amount of stuff, giving a lot
of immersion. The only sad part is that currently it becomes slow pretty fast
due to running on a single thread and has a pretty poor user interface.
Hopefully the Steam version that is coming will fix these problems.</p>

          <a class="no-underline" href="#rimworld">
              <h2 id="rimworld" class="group relative">
              <span class="hidden group-hover:inline absolute -left-8">#</span>
        Rimworld</h2></a>
<p>Pretty fun overall, seems a better version of Dwarf Fortress in some points but
lacks on a lot of others. It has much less content and does not have multiple Z
layers, but its user interface and gameplay are much better than DF.</p>

          <a class="no-underline" href="#roguelikes">
              <h1 id="roguelikes" class="group relative">
              <span class="hidden group-hover:inline absolute -left-8">#</span>
        Roguelikes</h1></a>
<p>Roguelike games really amuse me with all of their replayability and gameplay
style. This section will not differentiate from <em>roguelike</em> and <em>roguelite</em>, and
games from both categories might be present in here.</p>

          <a class="no-underline" href="#slay-the-spire">
              <h2 id="slay-the-spire" class="group relative">
              <span class="hidden group-hover:inline absolute -left-8">#</span>
        Slay the Spire</h2></a>
<p>This game makes me so happy. I never stopped to play games such as hearthstone,
and simply ignored the existence of <em>Gwent</em> when playing <em>The Witcher</em>, but Slay
the Spire really caught my attention. It is very fun to play, and requires a
nice amount of strategy when planning builds, fighting or even choosing your
paths and making choices in events.</p>

          <a class="no-underline" href="#faster-than-light-ftl">
              <h2 id="faster-than-light-ftl" class="group relative">
              <span class="hidden group-hover:inline absolute -left-8">#</span>
        Faster than Light (FTL)</h2></a>
<p>FTL is simply awesome. It has a <strong>Slay the Spire</strong>-like map navigation,
containing a galaxy map in which you travel and face different events and also
has a realtime action combat between starships. It is really fun to battle
starships and repair yours during combat, while planning upgrades to your
starship on the long run.</p>

          <a class="no-underline" href="#noita">
              <h2 id="noita" class="group relative">
              <span class="hidden group-hover:inline absolute -left-8">#</span>
        Noita</h2></a>
<p>Noita is a very uncommon game, it features a roguelike perma-death mechanic, has
the awesome feature of &quot;wand crafting&quot; and is non-linear, you don't just have a
single goal or boss for the game, you can explore secret areas, go to parallel
worlds or kill secret bosses.</p>

          <a class="no-underline" href="#multiplayer-shooters">
              <h1 id="multiplayer-shooters" class="group relative">
              <span class="hidden group-hover:inline absolute -left-8">#</span>
        Multiplayer Shooters</h1></a>
<p>While I like nice and comfy indie games, most of my friends do not. So when I
play something with them, it usually ends up being something such as <strong>CSGO</strong>,
<strong>Rainbow Six Siege</strong> or <strong>COD Warzone</strong>. I personally find these games funny if
played casually, but usually they have pretty toxic playerbases.</p>
