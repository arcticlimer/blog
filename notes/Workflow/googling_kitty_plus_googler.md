title: Googling using Kitty + Googler
---

Today I've discovered about [googler](https://github.com/jarun/googler).
Usually when I need to google something while programming, be it an error,
  issue or documentation I spin up a new browser tab with the query using [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb). Then I spend some more time scrolling down trying to find what I want. Using **googler**, I just need to enter my query and press `enter`, then I have a clean view of the search results and I can open them directly with my browser using [Kitty's hints](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/hints/), by pressing `ctrl+shift+e` and selecting the URL that I want to open.
