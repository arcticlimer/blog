title: The Dactyl Manuform Experience
---

Around April this year I've started getting crazy about mechanical ergonomic
split keyboards. After a lot of (over)thinking, I've decided to go with a Dactyl
Manuform Mini 5x6 over the original Manuform. Its thumb cluster just seems
better overall, most of the keys in the original's thumb cluster seem very
hard/painful to reach.

After buying some *blank white PBT keycaps* and *70 Gateron Milky Yellow* switches
from AliExpress, waiting a month for them to arrive and printing the case at the
local university, I've assembled the board with a total cost of around $70
dollars, much cheaper than the [ErgoDox](https://ergodox-ez.com/) that I was
considering before, which would easily cost more than 500$ after taxes in Brazil.

Another unique benefit of building your own keyboard is that you can use [QMK](https://qmk.fm), which allows you to write the firmware for your own keyboard easily. Thus making your keybinds and macros portable between different operational systems.

After two months of use, the keyboard is still holding strong and is very comfortable to type with. 10/10 would recommend.
