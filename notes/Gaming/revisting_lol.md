title: Revisiting and reviewing League of Legends
---

I've used to play a League of Legends **lot** a few years ago. The game is
actually funny, but after revisiting it for a week after a 2 years break, I can
still say that I'm better not playing it.

Don't take me wrong, the e-sports scenario with all the championships that
happen (CBLOL, Worlds, etc) are pretty fun and usually provides really beautiful
openings (See Worlds 2019 opening for an example).

It is awesome how the gameplay feels really awesome and balanced but the
community makes the game unplayable. People usually only do meta-picks trying to
elo climb and others can troll your game with ease. I don't necessarily see
these as problems if one just wants to play for fun, but considering the amount
of time this game takes (usually each match takes around 30 minutes) I just
can't play it.

So, nowadays I really prefer to have this game very far from my PC and I'm happy
to watch some of its e-sports championships main matches or consuming the
content that is created for these events.
